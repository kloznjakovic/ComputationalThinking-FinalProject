# ComputationalThinking-FinalProject
> This was my final semester project for my Computational Thinking Course at The University of Iowa. This code allows the user to create a budget plan for multiple categories, like groceries, housing, others, etc. and shows the spending limit for each category based on their monthly income and percentage they are willing to spend in each category.

## General Information
- This code allows the user to create a budget plan by inputting their monthly income and what percentage of that monthly income they want to spend on each category.
- I made this project so I could help myself with budget planning for post college and make sure I am not overspending in any category.
-Code uses input variables and an interactive program for users to calculate their spending limits and shows it in a bar chart.


## Technologies Used
- Spyder Desktop, Version 3.8


## Variables
List of input variables (code):
- MonthlyIncome = int(input("What is your monthly income?: $"))
- grocery = float(input("What percentage of Monthly Income do you want to spend on groceries?: "))
- gas = float(input("What percentage of Monthly Income do you want to spend on gas?: "))
- housing = float(input("What percentage of Monthly Income do you want to spend on housing?: "))
- utilities = float(input("What percentage of Monthly Income do you want to spend on utilities?: "))
- savings = float(input("What percentage of Monthly Income do you want to put into savings?: "))
- other = float(input("What percentage of Monthly Income do you want to spend on other?: "))
