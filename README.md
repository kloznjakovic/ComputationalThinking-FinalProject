# ComputationalThinking-FinalProject
> This was my final semester project for my Computational Thinking Course at The University of Iowa. This code allows the user to create a budget plan for multiple categories, like groceries, housing, others, etc. and shows the spending limit for each category based on their monthly income.

## General Information
- This code allows the user to see how many years/months it will take in order to pay back loans. It accounts for interest, amount borrowed, and goal time period of repayment.
- I made this project so I could calculate how long it would take me to pay back all my loans...the results were unfavorable to say the least.
-Code uses input variables and an interactive program for users to calculate their exact repayments.


## Technologies Used
- Spyder Desktop, Version 3.8


## Variables
List of input variables/calculations (code):
- 


## Plots
The code utilizes a bar chart to show limits for each category compared to what you spent that ...


## Project Status
Project is: complete
